# gPS Phoebe

*Real-time AI-based value based bidding with Google Ads products, that keeps
sensitive data away from determined end users.*

Use
[Server Side Tag Manager](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/server-side)
with [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), to generate real time
predictions based on ML models, and use them with Google Ads products and other
services to improve your targeting and bidding processes.

**NOTE**: The original soluion used a proxy app to facilitate the Vertex AI
lookup you can see [the code in v1.0.0](
    https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/gps-phoebe/tree/v1.0.0). This
was removed in v2.0.0 as sGTM added support for more general OAuth support.

> Tip üí°: Check out [the sGTM Pantheon](
    https://github.com/google-marketing-solutions/gps-sgtm-pantheon/tree/main)
for more tags for different use-cases.

> Important ‚ùóÔ∏è: Phoebe doesn't provide an AI model within Vertex AI. You can
    think of Phoebe as the plumbing between your tagging environment, your own
    custom model in Vertex AI, and where you want to send the value, e.g. Google
    Ads.

## Description

With server-side Tag Manager we are able to bid to a secret conversion value by
leveraging the built-in Firestore lookup (see
[gPS Soteria](https://github.com/google/gps_soteria)). One of the limitations
with this approach is that the conversion value needs to sit in Firestore before
the conversion happens. This prevents more advanced bidding use-cases that use
AI to determine this value.

gPS Phoebe allows users to leverage server-side Tag Manager to get predictions
directly from a Vertex AI model in real time, and use the predicted values as
secret conversion values to be used in value based bidding.

It's also possible to use a reCAPTCHA score as a feature for this model which
can be captured in real-time and provided to gPS Phoebe as a Request Data property (see
[gPS Cerberus](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/recaptcha-enterprise-google-tag-manager)).

The image below provides a high level overview of the core components involved,
and outlines the flow.

![Architecture](docs/img/architecture.png "Architecture")

1.  A GTM web container is used to set up tagging on the site, and is configured
    with a ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù event.
2.  The client‚Äôs website is set up to have an e-commerce purchase event in the
    data layer: this contains the revenue data. When a purchase is made, the
    event fires, sending the payload to a GTM server container.
3.  A custom variable is attached to a tag, triggered by ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù events,
    which queries the Vertex AI to get a prediction based on the provided data,
    and replaces the revenue conversion value with the predicted value.
4.  The updated event (with the predicted conversion value) is sent to Google
    Analytics, Google Ads or Floodlight.

## Demo Implementation

If you are interested in deploying an entire demo environment to test the
solution, along with a demo web store and sample tags in GTM, you can follow the
guide [here](demo/DEMO.md). Otherwise, skip to the next section for the
implementation guide.

## Implementation Guide

### Requirements

*   A Google Cloud project with billing enabled
*   A GTM server container up and running, and receiving events from a GTM web
    container
*   A Vertex AI endpoint with the model you want to us
*   It is recommended to have all the components in the same cloud region to
    reduce network latency

### Prepare the environment

Clone the repository to a local folder in your current environment (we recommend
using cloud shell for the deployment as it provides all required utilities out
of the box), using this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/gps-phoebe
```

If you are not using cloud shell, you must install the
[gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) in your environment.

### Configure Tag Manager

#### Import the template

Download the template file [here](gtm/variable_template.tpl).

From the Google Tag Manager UI, select your server container, go to the
`Templates` section, and click on `New`:

![New Template](docs/img/new_template.png "New Template")

Then, click on the top right options button, and select `Import`:

![Import Template](docs/img/import_template.png "Import Template")

Select the file you downloaded and continue. Then, click on `Save` and close the
template using the top left close button.

#### Create the variable

Now, from the Google Tag Manager UI, go to the `Variables` section, and click on
`New`:

![New Variable](docs/img/new_variable.png "New Variable")

Click on `Variable Configuration`to select a variable type:

![Variable Configuration](docs/img/variable_configuration.png "Variable Configuration")

And select `VertexAI Prediction`:

![VertexAI Prediction](docs/img/vertex_prediction.png "VertexAI Prediction")

Then, fill in the details of your environment in the configuration screen:

![Variable Details](docs/img/variable_details.png "Variable Details")

Apart from the required fields, you need to provide the request data that will
be sent to the Vertex AI endpoint. This data would depend on what your AI Model
requires. This is an example for our demo model:

![Request Data](docs/img/request_data.png "Request Data")

Fields will be included in the requests with *string* type. If your model
requires a parameter to be *integer* or *number* type, you can add a suffix to
indicate it to the system, `_int`for *integer* and `num` for *number*.

Remember to give it a name, and click `Save` when finished.

Finally, to add the predicted value coming from Vertex to the purchase or
conversion event, open the appropriate Tag and replace the conversion value (or
equivalent) field with the variable you just created.

For example, in Google Ads Conversion Tracking, you can use the `Conversion
Value` field:

![Google Ads Conversion Tracking](docs/img/google_ads_conversion.png "Google Ads Conversion Tracking")

## Permissions

The template uses sGTM's `getGoogleAuth` API, which uses Google Cloud's
[Application Default Credentials](
https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)
to access the service account running sGTM.

Open up [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) in Google Cloud,
and edit the service account principal to give it the [Vertex AI User role](
https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user)
(`roles/aiplatform.user`).
